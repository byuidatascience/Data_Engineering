Final Project Check-in
-------------

Review what you wrote for your [Final Project Proposal](../../4.4%20-%20Proposals/lab/README.md) and update it. Assess where you are on the five requirements and where you expect to be by the time you are done. Identify what is out-of-scope for your project and what you would do if you had more time.
