      "b\"THE SONNETS\\nby William Shakespeare\\n\\nI\\n\\nFrom fairest creatures we desire increase,\\nThat thereby beauty's rose might never die,\\nBut as the riper should by time decease,\\nHis tender heir might bear his memory:\\nBut thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,\\nFeed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,\\nMaking a famine where abundance lies,\\nThy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:\\nThou that art now the world's fresh ornament,\\nAnd only herald to the gaudy spring,\\nWithin thine own bud buriest thy content,\\nAnd tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:\\n  Pity the world, or else this glutton be,\\n  To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.\\n\\nII\\n\\nWhen forty winters shall besiege thy brow,\\nAnd dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,\\nThy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,\\nWill be a tatter'd weed of small worth held: \\nThen being asked, where all thy beauty lies,\\nWhere all the treasure of thy lusty days; \\nTo say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,\\nWere an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.\\nHow much more praise deserv'd thy beauty's use,\\nIf thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine\\nShall sum my count, and make my old excuse,'\\nProving his beauty by succession thine!\\n  This were to be new made when thou art old,\\n  And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.\\n\\nIII\\n\\nLook in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest\\nNow is the time that face should form another;\\nWhose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,\\nThou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.\\nFor where is she so fair whose unear'd womb\\nDisdains the tillage of thy husbandry?\\nOr who is he so fond will be the tomb,\\nOf his self-love to stop posterity? \\nThou art thy mother's glass and she in thee\\nCalls back the lovely April of her prime;\\nSo thou through windows of thine age shalt see,\\nDespite of wrinkles this thy golden time.\\n  But if thou live, remember'd not to be,\\n  Die single and thine image dies with thee.\\n\\nIV\\n\\nUnthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend\\nUpon thy self thy beauty's legacy?\\nNature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,\\nAnd being frank she lends to those are free:\\nThen, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse\\nThe bounteous largess given thee to give?\\nProfitless usurer, why dost thou use\\nSo great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?\\nFor having traffic with thy self alone,\\nThou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive:\\nThen how when nature calls thee to be gone,\\nWhat acceptable audit canst thou leave?\\n  Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,\\n  Which, used, lives th' executor to be.\\n\\nV\\n\\nThose hours, that with gentle work did frame\\nThe lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,\\nWill play the tyrants to the very same\\nAnd that unfair which fairly doth excel;\\nFor never-resting time leads summer on\\nTo hideous winter, and confounds him there;\\nSap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone,\\nBeauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:\\nThen were not summer's distillation left,\\nA liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,\\nBeauty's effect with beauty were bereft,\\nNor it, nor no remembrance what it was:\\n  But flowers distill'd, though they with winter meet,\\n  Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.\\n\\n\\nVI\\n\\nThen let not winter's ragged hand deface,\\nIn thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd:\\nMake sweet some vial; treasure thou some place\\nWith beauty's treasure ere it be self-kill'd.\\nThat use is not forbidden usury,\\nWhich happies those that pay the willing loan;\\nThat's for thy self to breed another thee,\\nOr ten times happier, be it ten for one;\\nTen times thy self were happier than thou art,\\nIf ten of thine ten times refigur'd thee:\\nThen what could death do if thou shouldst depart,\\nLeaving thee living in posterity?\\n  Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair\\n  To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.\\n\\nVII\\n\\nLo! in the orient when the gracious light\\nLifts up his burning head, each under eye\\nDoth homage to his new-appearing sight,\\nServing with looks his sacred majesty; \\nAnd having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill,\\nResembling strong youth in his middle age,\\nYet mortal looks adore his beauty still,\\nAttending on his golden pilgrimage:\\nBut when from highmost pitch, with weary car,\\nLike feeble age, he reeleth from the day,\\nThe eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are\\nFrom his low tract, and look another way:\\n  So thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon:\\n  Unlook'd, on diest unless thou get a son.\\n\\nVIII\\n\\nMusic to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?\\nSweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:\\nWhy lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,\\nOr else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?\\nIf the true concord of well-tuned sounds,\\nBy unions married, do offend thine ear,\\nThey do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds\\nIn singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear. \\nMark how one string, sweet husband to another,\\nStrikes each in each by mutual ordering;\\nResembling sire and child and happy mother,\\nWho, all in one, one pleasing note do sing:\\n  Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,\\n  Sings this to thee: 'Thou single wilt prove none.'\\n\\nIX\\n\\nIs it for fear to wet a widow's eye,\\nThat thou consum'st thy self in single life?\\nAh! if thou issueless shalt hap to die,\\nThe world will wail thee like a makeless wife;\\nThe world will be thy widow and still weep\\nThat thou no form of thee hast left behind,\\nWhen every private widow well may keep\\nBy children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:\\nLook! what an unthrift in the world doth spend\\nShifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;\\nBut beauty's waste hath in the world an end,\\nAnd kept unused the user so destroys it.\\n  No love toward others in that bosom sits\\n  That on himself such murd'rous shame commits.\\n\\nX\\n\\nFor shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,\\nWho for thy self art so unprovident.\\nGrant, if thou wilt, thou art belov'd of many,\\nBut that thou none lov'st is most evident:\\nFor thou art so possess'd with murderous hate,\\nThat 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire,\\nSeeking that beauteous roof to ruinate\\nWhich to repair should be thy chief desire.\\nO! change thy thought, that I may change my mind:\\nShall hate be fairer lodg'd than gentle love?\\nBe, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,\\nOr to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:\\n  Make thee another self for love of me,\\n  That beauty still may live in thine or thee.\\n\\nXI\\n\\nAs fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow'st,\\nIn one of thine, from that which thou departest;\\nAnd that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st,\\nThou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest,\\nHerein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase;\\nWithout this folly, age, and cold decay:\\nIf all were minded so, the times should cease\\nAnd threescore year would make the world away.\\nLet those whom nature hath not made for store,\\nHarsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:\\nLook, whom she best endow'd, she gave thee more;\\nWhich bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:\\n  She carv'd thee for her seal, and meant thereby,\\n  Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.\\n\\nXII\\n\\nWhen I do count the clock that tells the time,\\nAnd see the brave day sunk in hideous night;\\nWhen I behold the violet past prime,\\nAnd sable curls, all silvered o'er with white; \\nWhen lofty trees I see barren of leaves,\\nWhich erst from heat did canopy the herd,\\nAnd summer's green all girded up in sheaves,\\nBorne on the bier with white and bristly beard,\\nThen of thy beauty do I question make,\\nThat thou among the wastes of time must go,\\nSince sweets and beauties do themselves forsake\\nAnd die as fast as they see others grow;\\n  And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence\\n  Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.\\n\\nXIII\\n\\nO! that you were your self; but, love you are\\nNo longer yours, than you your self here live:\\nAgainst this coming end you should prepare,\\nAnd your sweet semblance to some other give:\\nSo should that beauty which you hold in lease\\nFind no determination; then you were\\nYourself again, after yourself's decease,\\nWhen your sweet issue your sweet form should bear. \\nWho lets so fair a house fall to decay,\\nWhich husbandry in honour might uphold,\\nAgainst the stormy gusts of winter's day\\nAnd barren rage of death's eternal cold?\\n  O! none but unthrifts. Dear my love, you know,\\n  You had a father: let your son say so.\\n\\nXIV\\n\\nNot from the stars do I my judgement pluck;\\nAnd yet methinks I have astronomy,\\nBut not to tell of good or evil luck,\\nOf plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;\\nNor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,\\nPointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,\\nOr say with princes if it shall go well\\nBy oft predict that I in heaven find:\\nBut from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,\\nAnd constant stars in them I read such art\\nAs 'Truth and beauty shall together thrive,\\nIf from thyself, to store thou wouldst convert'; \\n  Or else of thee this I prognosticate:\\n  'Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.'\\n\\nXV\\n\\nWhen I consider every thing that grows\\nHolds in perfection but a little moment,\\nThat this huge stage presenteth nought but shows\\nWhereon the stars in secret influence comment;\\nWhen I perceive that men as plants increase,\\nCheered and checked even by the self-same sky,\\nVaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,\\nAnd wear their brave state out of memory;\\nThen the conceit of this inconstant stay\\nSets you most rich in youth before my sight,\\nWhere wasteful Time debateth with decay\\nTo change your day of youth to sullied night,\\n  And all in war with Time for love of you,\\n  As he takes from you, I engraft you new.\\n\\nXVI\\n\\nBut wherefore do not you a mightier way\\nMake war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?\\nAnd fortify your self in your decay\\nWith means more blessed than my barren rhyme?\\nNow stand you on the top of happy hours,\\nAnd many maiden gardens, yet unset,\\nWith virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,\\nMuch liker than your painted counterfeit:\\nSo should the lines of life that life repair,\\nWhich this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,\\nNeither in inward worth nor outward fair,\\nCan make you live your self in eyes of men.\\n  To give away yourself, keeps yourself still,\\n  And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.\\n\\nXVII\\n\\nWho will believe my verse in time to come,\\nIf it were fill'd with your most high deserts?\\nThough yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb\\nWhich hides your life, and shows not half your parts. \\nIf I could write the beauty of your eyes,\\nAnd in fresh numbers number all your graces,\\nThe age to come would say 'This poet lies;\\nSuch heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'\\nSo should my papers, yellow'd with their age,\\nBe scorn'd, like old men of less truth than tongue,\\nAnd your true rights be term'd a poet's rage\\nAnd stretched metre of an antique song:\\n  But were some child of yours alive that time,\\n  You should live twice,--in it, and in my rhyme.\\n\\nXVIII\\n\\nShall I compare thee to a summer's day?\\nThou art more lovely and more temperate:\\nRough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\\nAnd summer's lease hath all too short a date:\\nSometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\\nAnd often is his gold complexion dimm'd,\\nAnd every fair from fair sometime declines,\\nBy chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd: \\nBut thy eternal summer shall not fade,\\nNor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,\\nNor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,\\nWhen in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,\\n  So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,\\n  So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.\\n\\nXIX\\n\\nDevouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,\\nAnd make the earth devour her own sweet brood;\\nPluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,\\nAnd burn the long-liv'd phoenix, in her blood;\\nMake glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,\\nAnd do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,\\nTo the wide world and all her fading sweets;\\nBut I forbid thee one most heinous crime:\\nO! carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,\\nNor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;\\nHim in thy course untainted do allow\\nFor beauty's pattern to succeeding men. \\n  Yet, do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,\\n  My love shall in my verse ever live young.\\n\\nXX\\n\\nA woman's face with nature's own hand painted,\\nHast thou, the master mistress of my passion;\\nA woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted\\nWith shifting change, as is false women's fashion:\\nAn eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,\\nGilding the object whereupon it gazeth;\\nA man in hue all 'hues' in his controlling,\\nWhich steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.\\nAnd for a woman wert thou first created;\\nTill Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,\\nAnd by addition me of thee defeated,\\nBy adding one thing to my purpose nothing.\\n  But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,\\n  Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.\\n\\nXXI\\n\\nSo is it not with me as with that Muse,\\nStirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,\\nWho heaven itself for ornament doth use\\nAnd every fair with his fair doth rehearse,\\nMaking a couplement of proud compare'\\nWith sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,\\nWith April's first-born flowers, and all things rare,\\nThat heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.\\nO! let me, true in love, but truly write,\\nAnd then believe me, my love is as fair\\nAs any mother's child, though not so bright\\nAs those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air:\\n  Let them say more that like of hearsay well;\\n  I will not praise that purpose not to sell.\\n\\nXXII\\n\\nMy glass shall not persuade me I am old,\\nSo long as youth and thou are of one date;\\nBut when in thee time's furrows I behold,\\nThen look I death my days should expiate. \\nFor all that beauty that doth cover thee,\\nIs but the seemly raiment of my heart,\\nWhich in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:\\nHow can I then be elder than thou art?\\nO! therefore love, be of thyself so wary\\nAs I, not for myself, but for thee will;\\nBearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary\\nAs tender nurse her babe from faring ill.\\n  Presume not on th;heart when mine is slain,\\n  Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again.\\n\\nXXIII\\n\\nAs an unperfect actor on the stage,\\nWho with his fear is put beside his part,\\nOr some fierce thing replete with too much rage,\\nWhose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;\\nSo I, for fear of trust, forget to say\\nThe perfect ceremony of love's rite,\\nAnd in mine own love's strength seem to decay,\\nO'ercharg'd with burthen of mine own love's might. \\nO! let my looks be then the eloquence\\nAnd dumb presagers of my speaking breast,\\nWho plead for love, and look for recompense,\\nMore than that tongue that more hath more express'd.\\n  O! learn to read what silent love hath writ:\\n  To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.\\n\\nXXIV\\n\\nMine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd,\\nThy beauty's form in table of my heart;\\nMy body is the frame wherein 'tis held,\\nAnd perspective it is best painter's art.\\nFor through the painter must you see his skill,\\nTo find where your true image pictur'd lies,\\nWhich in my bosom's shop is hanging still,\\nThat hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.\\nNow see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:\\nMine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me\\nAre windows to my breast, where-through the sun\\nDelights to peep, to gaze therein on thee; \\n  Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,\\n  They draw but what they see, know not the heart.\\n\\nXXV\\n\\nLet those who are in favour with their stars\\nOf public honour and proud titles boast,\\nWhilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars\\nUnlook'd for joy in that I honour most.\\nGreat princes' favourites their fair leaves spread\\nBut as the marigold at the sun's eye,\\nAnd in themselves their pride lies buried,\\nFor at a frown they in their glory die.\\nThe painful warrior famoused for fight,\\nAfter a thousand victories once foil'd,\\nIs from the book of honour razed quite,\\nAnd all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:\\nThen happy I, that love and am belov'd,\\nWhere I may not remove nor be remov'd.\\n\\nXXVI\\n\\nLord of my love, to whom in vassalage\\nThy merit hath my duty strongly knit,\\nTo thee I send this written embassage,\\nTo witness duty, not to show my wit:\\nDuty so great, which wit so poor as mine\\nMay make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,\\nBut that I hope some good conceit of thine\\nIn thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it:\\nTill whatsoever star that guides my moving,\\nPoints on me graciously with fair aspect,\\nAnd puts apparel on my tatter'd loving,\\nTo show me worthy of thy sweet respect:\\n  Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;\\n  Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.\\n\\nXXVII\\n\\nWeary with toil, I haste me to my bed,\\nThe dear respose for limbs with travel tir'd;\\nBut then begins a journey in my head\\nTo work my mind, when body's work's expired: \\nFor then my thoughts--from far where I abide--\\nIntend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,\\nAnd keep my drooping eyelids open wide,\\nLooking on darkness which the blind do see:\\nSave that my soul's imaginary sight\\nPresents thy shadow to my sightless view,\\nWhich, like a jewel (hung in ghastly night,\\nMakes black night beauteous, and her old face new.\\n  Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,\\n  For thee, and for myself, no quiet find.\\n\\nXXVIII\\n\\nHow can I then return in happy plight,\\nThat am debarre'd the benefit of rest?\\nWhen day's oppression is not eas'd by night,\\nBut day by night and night by day oppress'd,\\nAnd each, though enemies to either's reign,\\nDo in consent shake hands to torture me,\\nThe one by toil, the other to complain\\nHow far I toil, still farther off from thee. \\nI tell the day, to please him thou art bright,\\nAnd dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:\\nSo flatter I the swart-complexion'd night,\\nWhen sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.\\n  But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,\\n  And night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger.\\n\\nXXIX\\n\\nWhen in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes\\nI all alone beweep my outcast state,\\nAnd trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,\\nAnd look upon myself, and curse my fate,\\nWishing me like to one more rich in hope,\\nFeatur'd like him, like him with friends possess'd,\\nDesiring this man's art, and that man's scope,\\nWith what I most enjoy contented least;\\nYet in these thoughts my self almost despising,\\nHaply I think on thee,-- and then my state,\\nLike to the lark at break of day arising\\nFrom sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate,;\\n  For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings\\n  That then I scorn to change my state with kings.\\n\\nXXX\\n\\nWhen to the sessions of sweet silent thought\\nI summon up remembrance of things past,\\nI sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,\\nAnd with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:\\nThen can I drown an eye, unused to flow,\\nFor precious friends hid in death's dateless night,\\nAnd weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,\\nAnd moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:\\nThen can I grieve at grievances foregone,\\nAnd heavily from woe to woe tell o'er\\nThe sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,\\nWhich I new pay as if not paid before.\\n  But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,\\n  All losses are restor'd and sorrows end.\\n\\nXXXI\\n\\nThy bosom is endeared with all hearts,\\nWhich I by lacking have supposed dead;\\nAnd there reigns Love, and all Love's loving parts,\\nAnd all those friends which I thought buried.\\nHow many a holy and obsequious tear\\nHath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye,\\nAs interest of the dead, which now appear\\nBut things remov'd that hidden in thee lie!\\nThou art the grave where buried love doth live,\\nHung with the trophies of my lovers gone,\\nWho all their parts of me to thee did give,\\nThat due of many now is thine alone:\\n  Their images I lov'd, I view in thee,\\n  And thou--all they--hast all the all of me.\\n\\nXXXII\\n\\nIf thou survive my well-contented day,\\nWhen that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover\\nAnd shalt by fortune once more re-survey\\nThese poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,\\nCompare them with the bett'ring of the time,\\nAnd though they be outstripp'd by every pen,\\nReserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,\\nExceeded by the height of happier men.\\nO! then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:\\n'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age,\\nA dearer birth than this his love had brought,\\nTo march in ranks of better equipage:\\n  But since he died and poets better prove,\\n  Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love'.\\n\\nXXXIII\\n\\nFull many a glorious morning have I seen\\nFlatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,\\nKissing with golden face the meadows green,\\nGilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;\\nAnon permit the basest clouds to ride\\nWith ugly rack on his celestial face,\\nAnd from the forlorn world his visage hide,\\nStealing unseen to west with this disgrace: \\nEven so my sun one early morn did shine,\\nWith all triumphant splendour on my brow;\\nBut out! alack! he was but one hour mine,\\nThe region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.\\n  Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;\\n  Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.\\n\\nXXXIV\\n\\nWhy didst thou promise such a beauteous day,\\nAnd make me travel forth without my cloak,\\nTo let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,\\nHiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?\\n'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,\\nTo dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,\\nFor no man well of such a salve can speak,\\nThat heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:\\nNor can thy shame give physic to my grief;\\nThough thou repent, yet I have still the loss:\\nThe offender's sorrow lends but weak relief\\nTo him that bears the strong offence's cross. \\n  Ah!

food to life or as sweet season d showers are to the ground and for the peace of you i hold such strifeas twixt a miser and his wealth is found now proud as an enjoyer and anondoubting the filching age will steal his treasure now counting best to be with you alone then better d that the world may see my pleasure sometime all full with feasting on your sight and by and by clean starved for a look possessing or pursuing no delight save what is had or must from you be took thus do i pine and surfeit day by day or gluttoning on all or all away lxxviwhy is my verse so barren of new pride so far from variation or quick change why with the time do i not glance asideto new found methods and to compounds strange why write i still all one ever the same and keep invention in a noted weed that every word doth almost tell my name showing their birth and where they did proceed o know sweet love i always write of you and you and love are still my argument so all my best is dressing old words new spending again what is already spent for as the sun is daily new and old so is my love still telling what is told lxxviithy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear thy dial how thy precious minutes waste these vacant leaves thy mind s imprint will bear and of this book this learning mayst thou taste the wrinkles which thy glass will truly showof mouthed graves will give thee memory thou

assistance in my verseas every alien pen hath got my useand under thee their poesy disperse thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to singand heavy ignorance aloft to fly have added feathers to the learned s wingand given grace a double majesty yet be most proud of that which i compile whose influence is thine and born of thee in others works thou dost but mend the style and arts with thy sweet graces graced be but thou art all my art and dost advance as high as learning my rude ignorance lxxixwhilst i alone did call upon thy aid my verse alone had all thy gentle grace but now my gracious numbers are decay d and my sick muse doth give an other place i grant sweet love thy lovely argumentdeserves the travail of a worthier pen yet what of thee thy poet doth inventhe robs thee of and pays it thee again he lends thee virtue and he stole that wordfrom thy behaviour beauty doth he give and found it in thy cheek he can affordno praise to thee but what in thee doth live then thank him not for that which he doth say since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay lxxxo how i faint when i of you do write knowing a better spirit doth use your name and in the praise thereof spends all his might to make me tongue tied speaking of your fame but since your worth wide as the ocean is the humble as the proudest sail doth bear my saucy bark inferior far to his on your broad main doth wilfully appear your shallowest help will hold me up afloat whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride or being wrack d i am a worthless boat he of tall building and of goodly pride then if he thrive and i be cast away the worst was this my love was my decay lxxxior i shall live your epitaph to make or you survive when i in earth am rotten from hence your memory death cannot take although in me each part will be forgotten your name from hence immortal life shall have though i once gone to all the world must die the earth can yield me but a common grave when you entombed in men s eyes

worth in you doth grow this silence for my sin you did impute which shall be most my glory being dumb for i impair not beauty being mute when others would give life and bring a tomb there lives more life in one of your fair eyes than both your poets can in praise devise lxxxivwho is it that says most which can say more than this rich praise that you alone are you in whose confine immured is the storewhich should example where your equal grew lean penury within that pen doth dwellthat to his subject lends not some small glory but he that writes of you if he can tellthat you are you so dignifies his story let him but copy what in you is writ not making worse what nature made so clear and such a counterpart shall fame his wit making his style admired every where you to your beauteous blessings add a curse being fond on praise which makes your praises worse lxxxvmy tongue tied muse in manners holds her still while comments of your praise richly compil d reserve their character with golden quill and precious phrase by all the muses fil d i think good thoughts whilst others write good words and like unlettered clerk still cry amen to every hymn that able spirit affords in polish d form of well refined pen hearing you praised i say tis so tis true and to the most of praise add something more but that is in my thought whose love to you though words come hindmost holds his rank before then others for the breath of words respect me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect lxxxviwas it the proud full sail of his great verse bound for the prize of all too precious you that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse making their tomb the womb wherein they grew was it his spirit by spirits taught to write above a mortal pitch that struck me dead no neither he nor his compeers by nightgiving him aid my verse astonished he nor that affable familiar ghostwhich nightly gulls him with intelligence as victors of my silence cannot boast i was not sick of any fear from thence but

the worst to be if eyes corrupt by over partial looks be anchor d in the bay where all men ride why of eyes falsehood hast thou forged hooks whereto the judgment of my heart is tied why should my heart think that a several plot which my heart knows the wide world s common place or mine eyes seeing this say this is not to put fair truth upon so foul a face in things right true my heart and eyes have err d and to this false plague are they now transferr d cxxxviiiwhen my love swears that she is made of truth i do believe her though i know she lies that she might think me some untutor d youth unlearned in the world s false subtleties thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young although she knows my days are past the best simply i credit her false speaking tongue on both sides thus is simple truth suppressed but wherefore says she not she is unjust and wherefore say not i that i am old o love s best habit is in seeming trust and age in love loves not to have years told therefore i lie with her and she with me and in our faults by lies we flatter d be cxxxixo call not me to justify the wrongthat thy unkindness lays upon my heart wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue use power with power and slay me not by art tell me thou lov st elsewhere but in my sight dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside what need st thou wound with cunning when thy mightis more than my o erpress d defence can bide let me excuse thee ah my love well knowsher pretty looks have been mine enemies and therefore from my face she turns my foes that they elsewhere might dart their injuries yet do not so but since i am near slain kill me outright with looks and rid my pain cxlbe wise as thou art cruel do not pressmy tongue tied patience with too much disdain lest sorrow lend me words and words expressthe manner of my pity wanting pain if i might teach thee wit better it were though not to love yet love to tell me so as testy sick men when their deaths be near no news but health from their physicians know for if i should despair i should grow mad and in my madness might speak ill of thee now this ill wresting world is grown so bad mad slanderers by mad ears believed be that i may not be so nor thou belied bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide cxliin faith i do not love thee with mine eyes for they in thee a thousand errors note but tis my heart that loves what they despise who in despite of view is pleased to dote nor are mine ears with thy tongue s tune delighted nor tender feeling to base touches prone nor taste nor smell desire to be invitedto any sensual feast with thee alone but my five wits nor my five senses candissuade one foolish heart from serving thee who leaves unsway d the likeness of a man thy proud heart s slave and vassal wretch to be only my plague thus far i count my gain that she that makes me sin awards me pain cxliilove is my sin and thy dear virtue hate hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving o but with mine compare thou thine own state and thou shalt find it merits not reproving or if it do not from those lips of thine that have profan d their scarlet ornamentsand seal d false bonds of love as oft as mine robb d others beds revenues of their rents be it lawful i love thee as thou lov st thosewhom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee root pity in thy heart that when it grows thy pity may deserve to pitied be if thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide by self example mayst thou be denied cxliiilo as a careful housewife runs to catchone of her feather d creatures broke away sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatchin pursuit of the thing she would have stay whilst her neglected child holds her in chase cries to catch her whose busy care is bentto follow that which flies before her face not prizing her poor infant s discontent so runn st thou after that which flies from thee whilst i thy babe chase thee afar behind but if thou catch thy hope turn back to me and play the mother s part kiss me be kind so will i pray that thou mayst have thy will if thou turn back and my loud crying still cxlivtwo loves i have of comfort and despair which like two spirits do suggest me still the better angel is a man right fair the worser spirit a woman colour d ill to win me soon to hell my female evil tempteth my better angel from my side and would corrupt my saint to be a devil wooing his purity with her foul pride and whether that my angel be turn d fiend suspect i may yet not directly tell but being both from me both to each friend i guess one angel in another s hell yet this shall i ne er know but live in doubt till my bad angel fire my good one out cxlvthose lips that love s own hand did make breathed forth the sound that said i hate to me that languish d for her sake but when she saw my woeful state straight in her heart did mercy come chiding that tongue that ever sweetwas us d in giving gentle doom and taught it thus anew to greet i hate she alter d with an end that followed it as gentle day doth follow night who like a fiendfrom heaven to hell is flown away i hate from hate away she threw and sav d my life saying not you cxlvipoor soul the centre of my sinful earth my sinful earth these rebel powers array why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth painting thy outward walls so costly gay why so large cost having so short a lease dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend shall worms inheritors of this excess eat up thy charge is this thy body s end then soul live thou upon thy servant s loss and let that pine to aggravate thy store buy terms divine in selling hours of dross within be fed without be rich no more so shall thou feed on death that feeds on men and death once dead there s no more dying then cxlviimy love is as a fever longing still for that which longer nurseth the disease feeding on that which doth preserve the ill the uncertain sickly appetite to please my reason the physician to my love angry that his prescriptions are not kept hath left me and i desperate now approvedesire is death which physic did except past cure i am now reason is past care and frantic mad with evermore unrest my thoughts and my discourse as madmen s are at random from the truth vainly express d for i have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright who art as black as hell as dark as night cxlviiio me what eyes hath love put in my head which have no correspondence with true sight or if they have where is my judgment fled that censures falsely what they see aright if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote what means the world to say it is not so if it be not then love doth well denotelove s eye is not so true as all men s no how can it o how can love s eye be true that is so vexed with watching and with tears no marvel then though i mistake my view the sun itself sees not till heaven clears o cunning love with tears thou keep st me blind lest eyes well seeing thy foul faults should find cxlixcanst thou o cruel say i love thee not when i against myself with thee partake do i not think on thee when i forgotam of my self all tyrant for thy sake who hateth thee that i do call my friend on whom frown st thou that i do fawn upon nay if thou lour st on me do i not spendrevenge upon myself with present moan what merit do i in my self respect that is so proud thy service to despise when all my best doth worship thy defect commanded by the motion of thine eyes but love hate on for now i know thy mind those that can see thou lov st and i am blind clo from what power hast thou this powerful might with insufficiency my heart to sway to make me give the lie to my true sight and swear that brightness doth not grace the day whence hast thou this becoming of things ill that in the very refuse of thy deedsthere is such strength and warrantise of skill that in my mind thy worst all best exceeds who taught thee how to make me love thee more the more i hear and see just cause of hate o though i love what others do abhor with others thou shouldst not abhor my state if thy unworthiness rais d love in me more worthy i to be belov d of thee clilove is too young to know what conscience is yet who knows not conscience is born of love then gentle cheater urge not my amiss lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove for thou betraying me i do betraymy nobler part to my gross body s treason my soul doth tell my body that he maytriumph in love flesh stays no farther reason but rising at thy name doth point out thee as his triumphant prize proud of this pride he is contented thy poor drudge to be to stand in thy affairs fall by thy side no want of conscience hold it that i call her love for whose dear love i rise and fall cliiin loving thee thou know st i am forsworn but thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing in act thy bed vow broke and new faith torn in vowing new hate after new love bearing but why of two oaths breach do i accuse thee when i break twenty i am perjur d most for all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee and all my honest faith in thee is lost for i have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness oaths of thy love thy truth thy constancy and to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness or made them swear against the thing they see for i have sworn thee fair more perjur d i to swear against the truth so foul a lie cliiicupid laid by his brand and fell asleep a maid of dian s this advantage found and his love kindling fire did quickly steepin a cold valley fountain of that ground which borrow d from this holy fire of love a dateless lively heat still to endure and grew a seeting bath which yet men proveagainst strange maladies a sovereign cure but at my mistress eye love s brand new fired the boy for trial needs would touch my breast i sick withal the help of bath desired and thither hied a sad distemper d guest but found no cure the bath for my help lies where cupid got new fire my mistress eyes clivthe little love god lying once asleep laid by his side his heart inflaming brand whilst many nymphs that vow d chaste life to keepcame tripping by but in her maiden handthe fairest votary took up that firewhich many legions of true hearts had warm d and so the general of hot desirewas sleeping by a virgin hand disarm d this brand she quenched in a cool well by which from love s fire took heat perpetual growing a bath and healthful remedy
