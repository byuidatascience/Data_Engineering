Functional Programming
----------------------

Today we are going to look at some of the benefits of functional programming. Functional programming (FP) is one of the most important developments in software development methodologies, though it is often misunderstood and not nearly as well known as object oriented programming. The two are sometimes considered to be in conflict, but that is not necessarily the case. In fact, many languages (such as Scala and OCaml) are quite happily both OOP and FP languages. FP does involve a shift in orientation, however. I like to say that OOP puts _nouns_ at the center while FP puts _verbs_ at the center. This may be part of why people have difficulty with FP. It's a lot easier to visualize a noun than a verb. That said, as we will see, it can be very advantageous to think in terms of verbs. In fact, doing so has been a great help in developing distributed computing paradigms and is the basis of the MapReduce paradigm we've been using for the past week. To help with this, watch the following videos from the O'Reilly course [Functional Programming with Python](https://player.oreilly.com/videos/9781771374651). Begin with the first two:

1. [What Is Functional Programming?](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dsci/6007/videos/FP/004_what_is_functional_programming.mp4)
2. [Why Functional Programming?](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dsci/6007/videos/FP/005_why_functional_programming.mp4)

By the end of these two videos you should have a sense of what FP is and why we should use it. Now, skim through the [Functional Programming HOWTO](https://docs.python.org/3.5/howto/functional.html). You should come away with a sense of how generators work. You may also find [a practical introduction to functional programming](https://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/a-practical-introduction-to-functional-programming) valuable (even though it's for Python 2). Then watch the next four videos in the O'Reilly course:

3. [First-Class Functions](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dsci/6007/videos/FP/006_firstclass_functions.mp4)
4. [Recursion](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dsci/6007/videos/FP/007_recursion.mp4)
5. [Higher-Order Functions](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dsci/6007/videos/FP/008_higherorder_functions.mp4)
6. [Modifying Data Structures](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dsci/6007/videos/FP/009_modifying_data_structures.mp4)

These videos are just over a half-hour long altogether, but beware, he goes very fast through the examples, so be prepared to pause and take a look at what he's doing. You might want to duplicate his code and try modifying it to make sure you understand. It takes most people more than 4 minutes and 32 seconds to "get" recursion, so take it slow and I encourage you to watch these videos more than once.

Another useful resource is [Functional Programming in Python](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/functional-programming-python.csp) which you can download for free.

Finally, navigate over to the [PyToolz API Documentation](http://toolz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to get a sense of what this library is about.

#### On completing this article, you should have:

- Watched six (6) videos on **Functional Programming**
- Skimmed one HOWTO on Functional Programming
- Skimmed the documentation for PyToolz
- Optional: read "a practical introduction to functional programming"
- Optional: skimmed _Functional Programming in Python_
