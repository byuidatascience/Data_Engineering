Amazon Web Services, or AWS, is the cloud computing service we will be using in this course. Many startups and other tech companies (including most of your practicum sites) use AWS. To find out more about what this thing called "the cloud" is, and more about AWS in particular, start by watching:

- [What Is The Cloud?](http://infiniteskills.bc.cdn.bitgravity.com/iskills-media/awscloud-demo/0101.mp4) - ([Prezi](https://prezi.com/h-yzlfktxo3y/is_0101/))
- [Cloud Computing Basics](http://infiniteskills.bc.cdn.bitgravity.com/iskills-media/awsintro-demo/0101.mp4)

In this course we will be needing a lot of AWS. Following the instructions below to set up your account and claim the free credit that is available to you. By the end of watching those videos, you should be able to exlain what is the value of using AWS and roughly how it works.

### Step 1: Create an AWS account

1. Watch [Creating An AWS Account - Part 1](http://infiniteskills.bc.cdn.bitgravity.com/iskills-media/awsintro-demo/0104.mp4).  
This videos walk you through the actual process of setting up an AWS account as well the importance of setting up Identity & Access Management (IAM) accounts within that. For now, you only need to do the first part in order to proceed with the next step (that is, getting your Activate credit). 

2. Go to [http://aws.amazon.com/](http://aws.amazon.com/) and sign up:

	- You may sign in using your existing Amazon account or you can create a new account by selecting **Create a free account** using the button at the right, then selecting **I am a new user**.

	- Enter your contact information and confirm your acceptance of the AWS Customer Agreement.

	- Once you have created an Amazon Web Services Account, you may need to accept a telephone call to verify your identity. Some people have used Google Voice successfully if you don't have or don't want to
	  give a mobile number.

	- Once you have an account, go to
	  [http://aws.amazon.com/](http://aws.amazon.com/) and sign in. For now, you will work primarily from the Amazon Management Console.
