SQL (short for Structured Query Language) is the _lingua franca_ of data.  When you think of SQL database, you can think of tabular data, like you'd see in a spreadsheet.  Databases like MongoDB mainly operate on unstructured data like the JSON format we've been seeing with our tweets.  Unlike Python, SQL is neither imperative nor functional, but rather declarative. This can be a little disorienting if you're used to imperative programming, but it has many advantages.

Not long ago, there was a "NoSQL!" movement that originated from programmers who were frustrated with the limitations of traditional relational databases. Many of their frustrations were valid (such as difficulty in scaling) some were misplaced (some of the difficulties in object-relational mapping (ORM) have more to do with the implementation of SQL than the language itself) and some were simply ignorant (who needs JOINs anyway? Turns out: everyone). NoSQL has backed off and is now styling itself NOSQL, meaning "Not Only SQL" as people realized that the NoSQL movement had essentially thrown the baby out with the bathwater.

We'll start with the basics. Work through Khan Academy's [Intro to SQL](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql) course.
