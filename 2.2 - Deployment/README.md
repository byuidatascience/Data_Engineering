### Using Vagrant with AWS

Begin by reading Scott Lowe's blog on [Using Vagrant with AWS](http://blog.scottlowe.org/2016/09/15/using-vagrant-with-aws/).

You should also familiarize yourself with Oliver Veits' 4 part series on the same:
1. [Getting started with AWS](https://oliverveits.wordpress.com/2016/04/03/aws-automation-using-vagrant-part-1-getting-started-with-aws/) should be a review. Take a look if you still feel unclear on what AWS is, but there should be nothing new here.
2. [Installation and Usage of the Vagrant AWS Plugin](https://oliverveits.wordpress.com/2016/04/01/aws-automation-using-vagrant-a-hello-world-example/) is very similar to Scott Lowe's tutorial above, but goes into more detail and covers some things we will not need (like setting a HTTP proxy). If something in Scott's blog is unclear, perhaps Oliver's take will be more clear.
3. [Creating a Docker Host on AWS in 10 Minutes using Vagrant](https://oliverveits.wordpress.com/2016/04/06/aws-automation-using-vagrant-part-3-creating-a-docker-host-on-aws-in-10-minutes-using-vagrant/) is the next step in the series. It goes beyond what we are covering in this class but may be interesting to you if you want to explore Docker on your own.
4. [Using Terraform for AWS Automation](https://oliverveits.wordpress.com/2016/09/22/aws-automation-part-4-using-terraform-for-aws-automation/) goes beyond Vagrant and is useful for more complex systems. We will not need it for this course but you may find it useful in the future.

### A Workflow Management Platform

Watch Maxime Beauchemin talk about [Airbnb’s Airflow, an Open Source Data Pipeline Management Tool](https://vimeo.com/155057417). Then read through [Airflow: a workflow management platform](http://nerds.airbnb.com/airflow/). By the end of these, you should have a sense of what Airflow is, the motivation behind it, and how it compares to `cron`.

Finally, read through the Apache Airflow [Tutorial](https://pythonhosted.org/airflow/tutorial.html) to get a sense of how to actually use Airflow.

#### On completing this article, you should have:
