Lab
===
Individually (~30 min.)
------------
Consider your project: how does the architecture you are building (or have built) compare to Lambda architecture?  
1. Are you already using this architecture (perhaps without knowing it)? If so, identify which components comprise the batch layer, the serving layer, and the speed layer. If there are some components that seem to belong to more than one, or to none, make a note of that as well.  
2. To the extent that your architecture differs from Lambda architecture, in what ways is it different? Are there ideas from Lambda architecture that you would like to adopt? If so, what, and how? If not, why not? It is okay to reject Lambda architecture, but you should do so deliberately. So if you choose not to use an aspect of Lambda architecture, or you choose to combine to parts, you must be able to justify it.

In Small Groups (4-5 people) (~20 min.)
------------
Pick one of the projects in your small group and work on it together, refining it and preparing it for presentation. Divide the project into components and have each student focus on their component. As there are more students then layers, you may have to double up, divide a layer into parts, and/or have someone focus on an aspect of the system that does not neatly fall into exactly one of the layers. Each student will be responsible for explaining their component to the class. One student may also be responsible for overseeing the whole project, focusing on the interconnections between the parts.

As a Class (6 minutes each)
------------
Very briefly (each student has one minute) explain your component to the class. If there is time, accept questions and suggestions from the class.
