Batch Processing ML Jobs
---------

Today we'll be batch processing our Spark ML jobs.  In order to do this, we need to set the stage by making sure we have Spark installed locally.  Follow [this tutorial](http://blog.appliedinformaticsinc.com/how-to-write-spark-applications-in-python/).  Note that Spark moves fast so while this tutorial is still valid, the version of Spark it suggests is woefully outdated.  Check [Spark's download page](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html) to snag the latest version.

Once you've completed that, read through [this tutorial from AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/submitting-user-applications-with-spark-submit/).  This will give us some high-level intuition into how we'll be running our jobs.  In essence, we'll use our local machine to launch a cluster that performs a `spark-submit` job.
