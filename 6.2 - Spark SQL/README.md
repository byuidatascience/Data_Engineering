Programming with RDDs
--------------

Today we will use the EdX course to follow up Tuesday's lecture, this one entitled [Big Data Analysis with Apache Spark](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:BerkeleyX+CS110x+2T2016), diving right into [Week 3 - Programming with Resilient Distributed Datasets](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:BerkeleyX+CS110x+2T2016/courseware/b2e31dfc565c467099fd9277e28448d8/736a2f5af227429d9abbff9527f9a3e3/). Please watch the following before class:

1. [DataFrames and Resilient Distributed Datasets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPPJ56HqGc0)
2. [Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=che2yH8eJSs)
3. [Spark RDD Programming Model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujKexISlot0)
4. [Spark Shared Variables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69bEc26ZGY4)
5. [File Performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozcex-YLfrY)
6. [Entity Resolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hc2fm6_JVk)

Finally, watch the beginning of [Everyday I'm Shuffling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg2boMqLjCg) up to 15:20 (and perhaps rewatch the rest of Vida's part if you still feel unclear about where and when execution takes place). The main takeaway from this part is to understand the difference between `ShuffledHashJoin` and `BroadcastHashJoin` and when you would want to use each.
