Name: __________________________  

The Data Engineering Final Project for DSCI 6007 is an opportunity for you to demonstrate your ability to "Design and implement an end-to-end Big Data system". It will be solely evaluated by your separate github repo and presentation with the following Mastery levels and Success Criterion.  Be sure to submit a link to your github repo to Conor and Alessandro by the start of the first day of presentations.

0) __Missing__  
1) __Beginning__  
2) __Developing__  
3) __Accomplished__  
4) __Exemplary__
